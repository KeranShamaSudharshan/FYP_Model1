DATA PROCESSING RULES FOR MODEL TRAINING
=========================================

1. INITIAL CLUSTERING (Quiz# = 0):
   - Use initial Yes/No questions (Question Type = 'Initial_YesNo')
   - Features: Response Time, Network metrics (RTT, Jitter, Stability)
   - Purpose: Initial engagement level prediction before quiz starts

2. FOR COMPLETED QUESTIONS (Attempt Status = 'Completed'):
   - Use ONLY: Response Time (sec) and Is Correct
   - DO NOT USE: Network parameters (RTT, Jitter, Stability, Network Quality)
   - Reason: Student successfully completed, network is not a factor

3. FOR NOT COMPLETED QUESTIONS (Attempt Status = 'Not Completed'):
   - Use: Response Time (sec), Network parameters (RTT, Jitter, Stability)
   - Reason: Need to verify if network issue caused non-completion
   - Cross-reference with Participant_Tracking.csv for verification

4. PARTICIPANT TRACKING VALIDATION:
   - Check 'Participant_Tracking.csv' for join/leave events
   - Validate completion rate with Had Network Issue flag
   - If completion rate < 70% AND Had Network Issue = True: Consider network as factor
   - If completion rate < 70% AND Had Network Issue = False: Consider engagement issue

5. FEATURE SELECTION BY QUESTION STATUS:
   
   Completed Questions:
   - Response Time (sec)
   - Is_Correct_Binary
   - Student_Avg_Accuracy
   - Student_Avg_Response_Time
   
   Not Completed Questions:
   - Response Time (sec) [will be high]
   - RTT (ms)
   - Jitter (ms)
   - Stability (%)
   - Network_Quality_Encoded
   - Cross-check with Participant_Tracking data

6. MODEL TRAINING STRATEGY:
   - Initial Model: Train on Quiz# = 0 (initial questions) for baseline clustering
   - Main Model: Separate handling for Completed vs Not Completed
   - Use weighted approach or ensemble model
